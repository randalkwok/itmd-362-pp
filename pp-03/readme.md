## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=12P0u0kuqhouUrtt-lZy4aYvP79 
Your Rationale: Since it's a site for something new I wanted to use green as the main color in 
this monochromatic palette since green can be perceived as new beginnings. Also, I went for 
a brighter green because consoles these days like to boast performance and having a more neon
color shows aggressiveness and power.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52P0u0kw0w0jyC+oRxVy4oIDfjr 
Your Rationale: It only make sense to go towards the green side of the colour wheel for "spring"
and "gardens" since green screams nature. Instead of going for a darker green, I went with a lighter
green because spring is when everything becomes to bloom. The blue in my palette also reflects
the water that is necessary in any garden.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=31R0X0kwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX 
Your Rationale: I went for a base color of yellow because it's a happier color. Also when it is softer,
it can be calming, a good property for an app for kids. Naturally, the 2 other colors in this triadic palette
is blue and red. Blue is another calm color while red is a bit stronger, but it can be used to direct attention.
Overall, I chose brighter, happier colors to show that learning can be fun.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=b3H3e4c0kw0w0jyC+oRxVy4oIDfjr 
Your Rationale: When I think of cybersecurity, I think of the cliche green monospace font source code
on a black background, but I want to go with more sophisticated colors. A soft blue shows a more
tech oriented feel without using green. I actually ended up going towards a semi adjacent color palette
using a blue-green and blue-violet to give my palette accents to choose from.
