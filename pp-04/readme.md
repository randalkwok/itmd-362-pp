# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/layout/structure.html#structure-app-bar
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Although this is a website, this "app bar" is also commonly
used on Google's websites as well. So I took this idea and included an app bar on my sketch only using
a title, a sandwich side navigation button and a question mark icon on the upper right since that's where
the options button/icons are usually for Android.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigation-drawer.html
* How you implemented it in your sketch: One of the main problems with the myiit website right now is
how everything is cluttered up on the website. There are defined sections, but everything is still stuck together.
So I decided to go with Android's common, but effective side navigation drawer to put all the cluttered info
on to their own little section. I didn't sketch each and every page, but it will simply be the info on the myiit 
website.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/components/text-fields.html
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The main thing students use the myiit login page for is of course 
the login. That is why I made it the main focus on my sketch. I followed Google's guideline on the text input
field which means it must be identifiable, findable, and legible. Their unique style is to use a simple input line
which I used in my sketch. I made sure there is plenty of room for the user to touch the input fields.
